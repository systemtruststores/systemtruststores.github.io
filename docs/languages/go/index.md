# Go

[Go](https://golang.org) is "an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software".

Go supports the system truststore on:

- Windows
- macOS

Go uses the system truststore by default. You do not need to do anything extra to use it.

All modern versions of Go support this feature. (The macOS bindings are present in Go's source code at least as far back as v1.3 ([golang/go@4f23481](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/4f234814831c48a3bbc2b9a2d00242fad890facf)), which was released in 2014.)
